       205 +  > **🎯 ADHD TL;DR:** Common fixes for when your ADHD server acts up. No shame, no judgment - tech breaks sometimes. Here's how to fix it without losing your mind! 🔧⚡
       206 +  
       207 +  ### 🚨 "Server Won't Start" (The Most Common Hiccup)
       208 +  
       209 +  **🎯 ADHD TL;DR**: Usually Docker not running or another app stealing your port. Easy fixes!
       210 +  
       211 +  #### 🔧 Quick Victory Steps:
       212    ```bash
       213 -  # Check if Docker is running
       213 +  # 🎯 Step 1: Is Docker awake?
       214    docker --version
       215 +  # See version info? Docker is running! 🎉
       216 +  # Get errors? Start Docker Desktop or run: sudo systemctl start docker
       217    
       218 -  # Check what's using port 8000
       218 +  # ⚡ Step 2: Port detective work
       219    lsof -i :8000
       220 +  # Something there? Another app is using your port!
       221    
       222 -  # If something's using port 8000, change it:
       222 +  # 🚀 Step 3: Easy port fix
       223    # Edit docker-compose.yml, change "8000:8000" to "8080:8000"
       224    # Then visit http://localhost:8080 instead
       225 +  # BOOM! Port conflict solved! 🎉
       226    ```
       227    
       228 -  ### "Can't connect to OpenAI"
       228 +  #### 💡 **Pro ADHD Tip**: Docker Desktop makes this easier - just click start!
       229    
       230 -  **TL;DR**: Check your API key is correct and has credits.
       230 +  ### 🤖 "Can't Connect to OpenAI" (AI Brain Not Responding)
       231    
       232 +  **🎯 ADHD TL;DR**: Usually API key issues or account needs credits. Quick detective work!
       233 +  
       234 +  #### 🔍 Diagnose Your AI Connection:
       235    ```bash
       236 -  # Test your API key directly
       236 +  # 🧠 Test your API key magic
       237    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
       238      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-key-here"
       239    
       240 -  # Should return list of models. If not, check:
       241 -  # 1. Key is correct (no extra spaces)
       242 -  # 2. Account has credits
       243 -  # 3. Key has proper permissions
       240 +  # 🎉 Success = Long list of AI models
       241 +  # 💔 Error = One of these fixes needed:
       242    ```
       243    
       244 -  ### "Database errors"
       244 +  #### 🚀 Quick Fixes (In Order of Likelihood):
       245 +  1. **🔑 API Key Typos** → Check .env file, no extra spaces or line breaks
       246 +  2. **💰 Account Credits** → Visit OpenAI billing, add $5-10 credit
       247 +  3. **🚨 Key Permissions** → Create new API key with full permissions
       248 +  4. **🌐 Network Issues** → Try again in a few minutes
       249    
       250 -  **TL;DR**: Database container didn't start properly.
       250 +  #### 💙 **ADHD Friendly Reminder**: These issues are common and fixable! You're not broken!
       251    
       252 +  ### 🗃️ "Database Errors" (The Data Storage Hiccup)
       253 +  
       254 +  **🎯 ADHD TL;DR**: Database container got confused. Usually fixable with restart magic!
       255 +  
       256 +  #### 🔧 Database Revival Steps:
       257    ```bash
       258 -  # Check container status
       258 +  # 🎯 Step 1: Check what's actually running
       259    docker-compose ps
       260 +  # Look for "db" service - is it "Up" or "Exited"?
       261    
       262 -  # Restart database
       262 +  # ⚡ Step 2: Try the gentle restart
       263    docker-compose restart db
       264 +  # Wait 30 seconds, test your site again
       265    
       266 -  # If still broken, reset everything:
       266 +  # 🚀 Step 3: Nuclear option (if still broken)
       267    docker-compose down
       268    docker-compose up -d
       269 -  # (This will lose data, but fine for testing)
       269 +  # Fresh start! (Loses test data but that's fine)
       270    ```
       271    
       272 -  ### "Too slow / timing out"
       272 +  #### 💡 **ADHD Note**: Database issues look scary but are usually just "turn it off and on again"!
       273    
       274 -  **TL;DR**: Server needs more resources or network is slow.
       274 +  ### ⏰ "Too Slow / Timing Out" (Attention Span Killer Alert!)
       275    
       276 +  **🎯 ADHD TL;DR**: Your server needs more power or OpenAI is having a moment. Let's speed this up!
       277 +  
       278 +  #### 🚀 Speed Boost Fixes:
       279    ```bash
       280 -  # Check system resources
       280 +  # 🔍 Step 1: Resource detective work
       281    docker stats
       282 +  # High CPU/RAM usage? Your computer is working too hard!
       283    
       284 -  # If high CPU/memory usage:
       285 -  # 1. Close other applications
       286 -  # 2. Increase Docker resource limits
       287 -  # 3. Try smaller OpenAI model (in .env: MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo)
       284 +  # ⚡ Step 2: Quick performance fixes
       285 +  # 1. Close Chrome tabs (you know you have 47 open)
       286 +  # 2. Quit other apps hogging resources
       287 +  # 3. Increase Docker memory: Docker → Settings → Resources
       288 +  
       289 +  # 🧠 Step 3: Faster AI model (trade-off: speed vs intelligence)
       290 +  # Edit .env file: MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo
       291 +  # Restart: docker-compose restart adhd-server
       292    ```
