## **Section 1: A Framework for Democratic Legitimation Through Co-Design**

The development of affective computing systems, particularly those designed to influence user behavior like the proposed NudgeEngine, presents a profound ethical challenge. A system that infers a user's internal state and provides interventions to guide their actions cannot be ethically constructed using traditional, top-down design methodologies. Such an approach, where a small group of developers imposes its logic upon a diverse user base, risks creating a tool that is at best paternalistic and at worst manipulative and disempowering. To be trustworthy and genuinely empowering, the NudgeEngine requires more than mere user acceptance; it necessitates a form of "democratic legitimation," where its core logic and rules are derived from the active, informed, and sustained consent of the community it is intended to serve.1

This section outlines a comprehensive framework for achieving this legitimation. It is built upon a synthesis of two established methodologies: Participatory Design (PD) and Value-Sensitive Design (VSD). By integrating these approaches, we propose a concrete, phased co-design process that moves from designing *for* users to designing *with* and *by* them.2 This process treats users not as subjects of study but as "equal collaborators" and "experts of their own experience".3 Finally, this section confronts the significant practical and ethical challenges inherent in this approach—including power imbalances, value conflicts, and the need for sustained engagement—and proposes evidence-based strategies to mitigate them, ensuring the resulting system aligns with user values and respects human dignity.

### **1.1 The Imperative for Legitimation in Affective Systems**

The core ethical dilemma of the NudgeEngine lies in its potential to influence behavior based on inferred affective states. If the rules governing these nudges are determined solely by developers, the system operates on an imposed logic that may not align with a user's own reflective preferences, values, or goals. This creates an unacceptable power asymmetry and undermines the very objective of empowerment. The alternative is to ground the system's logic in democratic legitimation—a principle that interventions should be based on broad public support and collaborative agreement.1 This reframes the design process from a technical exercise into a sociopolitical one, where the goal is to build a system whose authority to "nudge" is earned through a transparent and participatory process.

This imperative is not unique to this project but reflects a broader shift in understanding the societal impact of artificial intelligence. As AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains that affect people's lives—from urban planning and healthcare to access to essential services—there is a growing consensus that public involvement is a prerequisite for responsible innovation.4 For systems developed with public resources or intended to serve the public interest, participatory methods are crucial for promoting transparency, building trust, and identifying potential biases or harms before deployment.5 The

NudgeEngine, by operating on the sensitive terrain of a user's emotional and cognitive state, falls squarely into this category of high-impact technology. Its development therefore demands a rigorous commitment to public involvement to ensure it aligns with societal values and builds the trust necessary for its adoption and effective use.6

### **1.2 Foundational Methodologies: A Synthesis of Participatory and Value-Sensitive Design**

To construct a process capable of delivering democratic legitimation, this framework integrates two complementary design methodologies: Participatory Design (PD) and Value-Sensitive Design (VSD). While distinct in their origins and focus, their combination creates a powerful, holistic approach to ethically-grounded technology development.

Participatory Design (PD) is a design philosophy and collection of methods centered on the active involvement of all stakeholders, especially end-users, as equal partners in the design process.4 Originating in the Scandinavian workplace democracy movements of the 1970s 3, PD is founded on principles of collaboration, empowerment, and inclusion. Its core tenet is that users are the experts of their own lived experiences and that their direct participation leads to more equitable, fair, and inclusive outcomes.4 In the context of AI, PD has proven vital for mitigating adverse societal impacts like algorithmic bias and opacity by incorporating a wide range of perspectives, particularly from marginalized and underrepresented communities.4

Value-Sensitive Design (VSD), pioneered by Batya Friedman and colleagues, provides a theoretical and methodological framework for systematically integrating human values into the design of technology from the very beginning of the process.7 VSD is not a single method but an approach that involves a tripartite investigation:

1. **Conceptual Investigation:** Identifying and articulating the human values at stake (e.g., autonomy, privacy, trust, fairness) and understanding how different stakeholders perceive them.  
2. **Empirical Investigation:** Using social science methods to understand how stakeholders experience or prioritize these values in the context of the technology.  
3. **Technical Investigation:** Analyzing how the technology's architecture and features support or hinder the identified values, and designing mechanisms that embody them.8

These two methodologies are not redundant but deeply complementary. PD provides the practical "how"—the collaborative structures and activities needed to engage stakeholders meaningfully. VSD provides the conceptual "what"—the focus on systematically identifying, analyzing, and embedding specific human values. The stakeholder-centric ethos of PD is the perfect vehicle for conducting the conceptual and empirical investigations required by VSD. For instance, a participatory workshop (a PD method) can be used to elicit stakeholder values regarding privacy (a VSD concern). In essence, PD operationalizes the value-discovery and stakeholder-analysis components of VSD, while VSD provides the analytical lens to ensure the collaborative work remains focused on core ethical principles. The following table clarifies their distinct and overlapping contributions.

**Table 1: Comparison of Participatory Design and Value-Sensitive Design Methodologies**

| Feature | Participatory Design (PD) | Value-Sensitive Design (VSD) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Core Goal** | To democratize the design process by empowering users to share in decision-making power.3 | To systematically integrate human values into technology design from its inception.7 |
| **Key Actors** | End-users, designers, researchers, and other stakeholders as equal co-creators.6 | Designers, technologists, and social scientists, in consultation with direct and indirect stakeholders.8 |
| **Primary Output** | A co-created product or system that reflects the genuine needs and preferences of its users.10 | A technology whose design features verifiably support and embody explicitly articulated human values.7 |
| **Typical Methods** | Collaborative workshops, co-prototyping, focus groups, storytelling, scenario building.3 | Tripartite investigation (conceptual, empirical, technical), value-oriented interviews, stakeholder analysis.8 |
| **Main Challenge** | Managing power dynamics, ensuring sustained engagement, and handling resource constraints.4 | Operationalizing abstract values into concrete technical requirements; balancing conflicting values.7 |

### **1.3 A Phased Co-Design Process for the NudgeEngine**

Grounded in the synthesis of PD and VSD, the development of the NudgeEngine will follow a multi-stage, iterative methodology. It is crucial to recognize that co-design is a sustained process, not a single event or a series of disconnected workshops.3 Each phase builds upon the last, progressively deepening the collaboration between developers and the user community.

#### **Phase A: Requirements Analysis and Mutual Learning**

The initial phase is dedicated to fostering a climate of mutual learning and establishing a shared understanding between the development team and future users. The primary principle of this phase is to treat end-users as the undisputed domain experts on their own needs, goals, and challenges.3 The objective is not to "educate" users about the technology but for the developers to learn from the users' lived experiences.

* **Methods:** This phase will involve a series of collaborative workshops and focus groups designed to be inclusive and engaging.3 Techniques will be drawn from established PD practice to facilitate rich dialogue. This includes  
  **storytelling**, where participants share personal narratives related to focus, energy, and well-being, and **scenario building**, where groups collaboratively imagine future interactions with an affective computing system.3  
  **Mind mapping** and **brainstorming** sessions will be used to generate a wide array of ideas and needs without premature judgment.10 A key activity will be the  
  **co-creation of user personas**. Unlike traditional designer-led persona creation, which risks embedding developers' assumptions 12, this process will involve users directly in constructing representative personas, ensuring they are grounded in authentic, collective experience.

#### **Phase B: Iterative Design and Collaborative Prototyping**

This phase translates the abstract needs and values identified in Phase A into tangible artifacts. The guiding principle is that user feedback must drive the iterative design process, ensuring the final product is fit-for-purpose as determined by those who will use it. This hands-on approach guarantees that the end product meets actual user needs and preferences.10

* **Methods:** Users will participate in a series of co-design sessions focused on **low-fidelity prototyping**. The emphasis will be on accessible, non-technical tools like paper, cardboard, and arts-and-crafts materials, which allow all participants, regardless of technical skill, to contribute to the design of interfaces and interactions.4 These prototypes will be tangible representations of the  
  NudgeEngine's UI, the consent mechanisms, and the presentation of nudges. Following each prototyping session, the group will engage in **user testing** of the created artifacts.10 Developers will observe how users interact with the prototypes, listen to their feedback, and collaboratively identify areas for improvement. This cycle of "create, test, iterate" is central to the methodology and helps reduce costly rework later in the development cycle by identifying issues early.10

#### **Phase C: Rule Co-Creation and Participatory Governance**

This is the most critical phase for achieving democratic legitimation. It moves beyond the co-design of interfaces to the co-creation of the system's core logic. The principle here is that the rules of the NudgeEngine must be co-authored with the community they serve, shifting power from the developer to the user and ensuring that interventions are based on collective consent.1 This approach seeks to embed user preferences directly into the operational mechanisms of the system, a key step toward meaningful participation.13

* **Methods:** This phase will be structured through a series of **deliberative workshops** where users can collectively define, debate, and vote on the types of nudges they find acceptable and helpful for different user\_state contexts.14 For example, participants will discuss what constitutes a helpful nudge for a state of "high anxiety" versus "low energy." This process will determine the default rule sets for the  
  NudgeEngine as well as the range of available customization options. To ensure accountability and broad representation, these rules may be ratified by **multi-stakeholder panels** composed of a balanced mix of users, developers, domain experts, and ethicists.15 The governance structure will address both  
  **horizontal rules** (overarching principles that apply to all nudges, such as transparency and easy dismissibility) and **vertical rules** (context-specific interventions). This hybrid approach, combining broad, predictable principles with tailored, application-specific rules, is essential for creating a regulatory framework that is both robust and flexible.16

### **1.4 Navigating the Critical Challenges of Participation**

While the benefits of co-design are substantial, its practical implementation is fraught with challenges. Acknowledging and proactively mitigating these challenges is essential for the integrity of the process. Optimistic claims about empowerment must be tempered with a realistic understanding of the complexities involved, particularly concerning power, diversity, and sustained engagement.4

#### **Challenge 1: Addressing Power Imbalances**

The most pervasive challenge in participatory work is the management of power. Design is never a neutral act; it is embedded in and reinforces existing societal norms and power structures.12 Power imbalances can exist between designers and participants (due to technical expertise, control over resources, etc.) and among participants themselves (due to social status, verbal fluency, etc.), impeding the goal of equal contribution.17 This is a particularly acute risk when working with individuals from marginalized or "vulnerable" groups, who may be at risk of being overlooked or having their voices silenced.19

* **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  * **Acknowledge and Map Power:** The first step is to make power dynamics visible. This involves being explicit about where power lies within the project (e.g., who holds the budget, who makes the final decision).20 Tools like creating a "power inventory" for all participants can help map out different forms of power (e.g., technical knowledge, lived experience, social connections) and facilitate a discussion about how to balance them.21  
  * **Use Accessible and Inclusive Language:** Technical jargon is a significant source of power imbalance, as it can alienate non-experts and create an intimidating atmosphere.22 The facilitation team must commit to using plain, simple language. For example, instead of asking participants to "prototype an interaction," the prompt would be to "sketch out some ideas for how this could work".22  
  * **Employ Non-Verbal and Activity-Based Methods:** To ensure that participation is not dominated by the most verbally fluent individuals, the process must incorporate a variety of methods. Using visual techniques like diagramming, creating physical models, or asking participants to vote by placing stones on a chart de-emphasizes verbal communication and provides alternative channels for expression. This allows more reticent or marginalized members of the group to participate meaningfully.23  
  * **Foster Psychological Safety:** A safe and welcoming environment is a prerequisite for genuine participation. Facilitators must model best-practice behaviors, such as non-judgmental curiosity and respect for all contributions.24 This also includes practical considerations like meeting in neutral, community-based locations where users feel comfortable, rather than corporate offices, and sharing food to break down hierarchies.22  
  * **Compensate Participants Fairly:** Participation is labor. All participants must be fairly compensated for their time, expertise, and contributions. This is a fundamental act of respect that acknowledges the value of their involvement and helps to level the playing field.22

#### **Challenge 2: Managing Participant Diversity and Conflicting Values**

A successful co-design process will bring together a diverse group of stakeholders, whose needs, values, and preferences will inevitably vary and may even conflict.7 Forcing consensus in such situations can lead to a "lowest common denominator" solution that satisfies no one.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  * **Prioritize Granular Customization:** The primary strategy for managing value conflicts is to design for user choice. Where consensus on a single default behavior is not possible, the co-design process should shift its focus to defining the *range* of acceptable options from which a user can choose. The goal becomes co-creating a robust set of customization features, empowering each user to align the system with their personal values.  
  * **Co-Define Fairness Collaboratively:** The concept of "fairness" itself must be a subject of co-design. Rather than relying on a purely technical or statistical definition of fairness, the project must facilitate a dialogue with participants to arrive at a shared understanding of what constitutes a fair or unfair outcome in the context of the NudgeEngine. This process of co-defining fairness ensures that the system's evaluation metrics are aligned with the community's expectations and address the harms they are most concerned about.14

#### **Challenge 3: Ensuring Sustained and Meaningful Engagement**

One of the most common pitfalls of participatory projects is "lightweight engagement"—one-off workshops or focus groups that are labeled "co-design" but fail to achieve genuine power-sharing or influence.4 Meaningful participation requires a significant and sustained commitment of time and resources from both the organization and the participants, which can be a major practical barrier.6

* **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  * **Plan and Budget for Long-Term Collaboration:** The project must treat co-design as an ongoing activity that extends throughout the entire product lifecycle, including post-launch evaluation and co-delivery of updates.2 This requires dedicated budget allocation and realistic timelines that account for the iterative nature of the process.  
  * **Leverage Technology for Sustained Participation:** To maintain engagement between in-person sessions, the project can use accessible digital tools. This could include shared documents for asynchronous commenting (e.g., using Google Docs to solicit feedback 3), online forums, or dedicated community platforms that allow for continuous dialogue and feedback.  
  * **Build Trusting Community Partnerships:** Rather than recruiting participants from scratch, the project should seek to partner with existing community organizations, especially those that have already built trusting relationships with the target user groups.22 These partnerships are invaluable for reaching diverse communities, building credibility, and fostering the social connections that are the foundation of effective and sustained co-design.20

A crucial connection emerges when considering these challenges and their mitigations. The very principles required to run an ethical and inclusive co-design process—such as using clear, simple language and respecting participants' cognitive load—are the same principles required to design an ethical and empowering user interface. A failure to translate the values of the process into the design of the product creates a sociotechnical contradiction. For example, a workshop facilitator would not present participants with a dense, 50-page legalistic document to approve a rule; they would break it down into simple, understandable components. Similarly, the final UI should not present the user with a wall of text in a privacy policy. The system's interface for consent and control must mirror the accessibility and respect shown in the co-design workshops. This creates a powerful feedback loop: the requirements of a dignity-preserving UI enforce a discipline of clarity and simplicity on the rule co-creation process itself. If a co-created rule is too complex to be explained in a simple, "just-in-time" notice, it is a signal that the rule itself is flawed and must be simplified, not that the UI needs more text. In this way, the design of the artifact and the design of the participatory process become mutually reinforcing, ensuring that the democratic values of the process are truly embodied in the final product.

## **Section 2: A Technical Architecture for Privacy, Control, and Trust**

The user\_state model, by its very nature, will collect and process data that is deeply personal and sensitive. To build a system that users can trust, the technical architecture must be grounded in a robust and uncompromising commitment to privacy. This commitment cannot be an afterthought or a feature bolted onto an existing system; it must be the foundational principle upon which the entire architecture is built. This section details such an architecture, guided by the seven principles of Privacy by Design (PbD). It proposes a **local-first software architecture** as the cornerstone of this approach—a choice that is not merely technical but is a fundamental declaration of user sovereignty over their own data. This section will specify the technologies for on-device storage and secure synchronization, outline UI/UX patterns for achieving meaningful and granular user consent, and explore advanced privacy-preserving machine learning techniques to ensure the system is not only private today but is future-proofed against emerging threats and capabilities.

### **2.1 The Principle of Privacy by Design as a Non-Negotiable Foundation**

Privacy by Design (PbD) is a framework developed by Dr. Ann Cavoukian that mandates a proactive, not reactive, approach to privacy.26 Instead of treating privacy breaches as incidents to be remediated after the fact, PbD requires that privacy be "embedded into design," making it a core, functional component of the system from the very beginning.26 This principle applies not only to the system's technical architecture but also to organizational priorities and business practices.26 The framework is articulated through seven foundational principles, of which the following are most critical for the

user\_state model:

1. **Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial:** The system must be designed from the ground up to prevent privacy invasions before they can occur.  
2. **Privacy as the Default Setting:** This is the paramount principle for this project. It ensures that users are granted the maximum level of privacy protection by default, without having to take any action. This includes strict **data minimization** (collecting only the data absolutely necessary for a given function), **purpose limitation** (using data only for the purpose to which the user consented), and **retention limitation** (deleting data once it is no longer needed).26  
3. **Privacy Embedded into Design:** Privacy considerations must be integral to every stage of the design and development lifecycle, treated with the same importance as core functionality.  
4. **Full Functionality — Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum:** This rejects the false dichotomy between privacy and functionality, advocating for designs that achieve both without trade-offs.  
5. **End-to-End Security — Lifecycle Protection:** Data must be securely protected throughout its entire lifecycle, from creation to secure destruction.  
6. **Visibility and Transparency — Keep it Open:** The system's operations and data practices must be transparent and verifiable to users and regulators.  
7. **Respect for User Privacy — Keep it User-Centric:** The user's interests must be at the center of all design decisions, empowering them with control over their own data.

### **2.2 Local-First Software: An Architecture of User Sovereignty**

To realize the principles of PbD in their strongest form, the user\_state model will be built upon a **local-first software architecture**. This paradigm fundamentally inverts the standard cloud-centric model. Instead of treating a remote server as the primary repository of data, a local-first application treats the user's own device (laptop, phone, tablet) as the primary source of truth.27 The cloud becomes a secondary, optional endpoint used only for services the user explicitly enables, such as backup or multi-device synchronization.27

This architectural choice is a direct implementation of the PbD principles of user-centricity and privacy by default. It provides users with ultimate ownership and control over their data, as the data resides physically on devices they own.27 The benefits of this approach are captured in the seven ideals of local-first software, as articulated by the research group Ink & Switch 27:

1. **No spinners (Speed):** Because operations happen locally, they are fast and not dependent on network latency.  
2. **Your work is not trapped on one device:** Data can be seamlessly synchronized across all of a user's devices.  
3. **The network is optional:** The application is fully functional offline.  
4. **Seamless collaboration:** The architecture can support real-time collaboration between users.  
5. **The Long Now (Longevity):** The user's data remains accessible and under their control, independent of the company that created the software.  
6. **Security and privacy by default:** By avoiding the creation of a massive, centralized database of sensitive user data, the system presents a much smaller and less attractive target for attackers.  
7. **You retain ultimate ownership and control:** The user has full agency to view, modify, back up, or delete their data files without needing permission from a service provider.27

The growing local-first ecosystem is supported by a range of open-source tools and libraries that facilitate the development of such applications, including any-sync, Automerge, and others, which provide foundational components for data synchronization and storage.28 The following table provides a clear comparison of the trade-offs between the traditional cloud-centric model and the proposed local-first architecture, justifying the latter as the only viable choice for a system built on trust and privacy.

**Table 2: Architectural Trade-offs: Local-First vs. Cloud-Centric**

| Attribute | Cloud-Centric Architecture | Local-First Architecture |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Data Store** | Remote company-controlled server | User's local device 27 |
| **User Control/Ownership** | Low; user has access via API/UI, but does not own the data store. Can be locked out.27 | High; user has direct ownership and control of their data files.27 |
| **Privacy (by default)** | Low; data is centralized and accessible to the service provider. | High; data remains on the user's device by default, minimizing exposure.27 |
| **Security (attack surface)** | High; centralized server is a high-value target for data breaches. | Low; decentralized data distribution avoids creating a single point of failure or attack.27 |
| **Offline Functionality** | None or limited; requires a network connection to function.27 | Full; the application is designed to work offline by default.27 |
| **Performance (latency)** | Variable; dependent on network speed and server response time. | High; local operations are near-instantaneous, with no network latency.27 |
| **Data Longevity** | Low; data is lost if the service shuts down. | High; data remains accessible indefinitely on the user's device.27 |
| **Developer Complexity** | Familiar model for many developers, but offline support is difficult to retrofit. | Can be a newer paradigm for developers, but frameworks are emerging to simplify implementation.29 |

### **2.3 Technical Implementation: On-Device Storage and Secure Synchronization**

The implementation of the local-first architecture for the user\_state model will rely on proven, robust technologies for on-device storage and optional, secure synchronization.

* **On-Device Database:** The user\_state model data will be stored locally in an on-device database. The recommended technology for this purpose is **SQLite**. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine that is an ideal choice for this use case.30 It is widely used as the application file format for mobile and desktop applications, requires no administration, and is highly reliable and efficient.30 Its nature as a single, cross-platform file makes it perfectly suited for a local-first model where the user's data must be portable and self-contained.31  
* **End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) Synchronization:** For users who choose to enable cloud backup or synchronization across multiple devices, the protocol must be uncompromisingly secure. All user\_state data must be **end-to-end encrypted**, meaning it is encrypted on the user's device before being transmitted, and can only be decrypted by other trusted devices owned by the same user.33 The server infrastructure must be designed to be  
  **zero-knowledge**; it should only ever store and relay encrypted data blobs, with no ability to access the decryption keys or the underlying content.34 This ensures that even in the event of a server-side data breach, the user's sensitive information remains secure.33 To implement this, the project will leverage well-vetted, open-source E2EE protocols and libraries. Building a custom cryptographic protocol is a known anti-pattern fraught with security risks.36 Instead, the project should build upon established frameworks like the one provided by  
  **any-sync**, which is explicitly designed for local-first, E2EE, peer-to-peer applications 28, or the cryptographic ratchets used in the  
  **Matrix** protocol (Olm/Megolm), which are available via libraries like libolm and vodozemac.37

### **2.4 The User Experience of Consent: Designing for Granular Control**

A privacy-preserving architecture is necessary but not sufficient. The user interface through which users manage their privacy settings must be equally robust, designed to be transparent, intuitive, and empowering. The primary challenge is to overcome "consent fatigue"—the cognitive exhaustion users experience from being constantly bombarded with privacy pop-ups, which leads them to click "accept" without genuine understanding or agreement.38 The goal is to transform the moment of consent from a point of friction into a "lean-in" experience of informed choice.38

This will be achieved by implementing a set of user-centric UI/UX patterns:

* **Just-in-Time Notices:** Instead of presenting users with a long, monolithic privacy policy upon first use, the system will employ context-aware prompts that appear "just-in-time".40 When a feature requires access to a new type of data, a concise notice will explain exactly what data is needed and for what specific purpose, clarifying the value proposition for the user at the moment of decision.38  
* **Layered Information (Progressive Disclosure):** To avoid overwhelming users with information, consent interfaces will use a layered approach. The initial prompt will provide a high-level choice with clear options. Users who want more information can easily "drill down" into more detailed explanations.38 This respects user attention while ensuring full transparency is available.42  
* **Granular Controls:** The system will scrupulously avoid a single "accept all" button that bundles unrelated data uses. Instead, users will be presented with granular controls, typically a series of un-pre-ticked checkboxes, allowing them to consent to specific types of data processing independently (e.g., "Allow mood tracking from text input" but "Disallow energy level inference from calendar events").43  
* **Easy Revocation:** A dedicated and easily accessible section within the app's settings will allow users to review all permissions they have granted at any time and revoke any of them with a simple action.41  
* **Avoidance of Dark Patterns:** The UI will be designed to be honest and transparent, strictly avoiding any deceptive "dark patterns." This includes not pre-selecting checkboxes, not making the "decline" option difficult to see or use, and not using manipulative language to guilt users into consenting.43

### **2.5 Future-Proofing Privacy: Advanced Preserving Techniques**

To ensure the system remains at the forefront of privacy protection as it evolves and incorporates more sophisticated machine learning features, the framework includes a roadmap for adopting advanced privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) techniques.

* **Federated Learning (FL):** For any future features that require personalized models trained on user data, the system will utilize Federated Learning. FL is a distributed machine learning approach where a model is trained directly on a user's device, meaning the sensitive raw data never has to be sent to a central server.46 Only the resulting model updates—anonymized and aggregated—are shared to improve a global model.46 This technique is a powerful implementation of the data minimization principle and is already used by Google to train models for features in Android, such as keyboard predictions and Smart Text Selection, without accessing user data directly.48  
* **Differential Privacy (DP):** If any aggregate analytics on user behavior are ever required for product improvement, they will be performed using Differential Privacy. DP is a rigorous mathematical framework that provides a provable guarantee of privacy.52 It works by adding a precisely calibrated amount of statistical noise to a dataset or the results of a query, making it impossible to determine whether any single individual's data was included in the analysis.53 The strength of this privacy guarantee is controlled by a parameter, epsilon (  
  ϵ), where a lower value corresponds to stronger privacy.55 DP is used in production by major technology companies like Apple and Google, as well as by the U.S. Census Bureau, demonstrating its real-world viability.56 DP can be powerfully combined with FL by having each device add noise to its model update before it is sent for aggregation, providing user-level privacy guarantees for the entire learning process.51

The choice of a local-first architecture in the initial design phase creates a powerful synergy with these advanced privacy techniques. The architectural decision to prioritize on-device data storage and processing is not merely compatible with Federated Learning; it is a direct enabler of it. A traditional cloud-centric system, where all user data resides on a remote server, is fundamentally unsuited for FL. To implement FL, such a system would first need to be re-architected to store and process data locally—in effect, it would have to become a local-first application. By committing to a local-first architecture from the outset for its inherent privacy and user-control benefits, the project also lays the necessary groundwork for the future adoption of state-of-the-art PPML. The user\_state data will already be on the device, ready to be used for on-device training. This strategic alignment ensures that the architecture of today is perfectly positioned for the responsible AI capabilities of tomorrow, dramatically lowering the future barrier to entry for these critical privacy-enhancing technologies.

## **Section 3: Adversarial Collaboration: A Dignity-Preserving Interaction Framework**

Having established the principles for the democratic creation of rules and the technical architecture for privacy, this final section addresses the crucial question of the user's moment-to-moment experience with the NudgeEngine. A system can have legitimate rules and a private architecture but still feel coercive or disempowering in its interaction design. To ensure the NudgeEngine is helpful and not manipulative, its interaction model must be designed to preserve user dignity and enhance, rather than bypass, user autonomy.

This section proposes a novel interaction framework called **Adversarial Collaboration**. This framework moves beyond a simple assistive or directive model, reframing the AI's role from that of an authority to that of a supportive critic. The fundamental goal is to design interactions that stimulate and sharpen the user's own cognitive faculties—their executive function, critical thinking, and capacity for self-reflection. By positioning the AI as a tool that helps the user improve their own thinking, this framework ensures that the user remains firmly in command, thereby preserving their intelligence and dignity.

### **3.1 Beyond Assistance: The Case for Adversarial Collaboration**

Most contemporary Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC) frameworks focus on the efficient allocation of tasks between human and AI, often categorizing interactions as human-led, AI-led, or symbiotic.61 While these models are useful for productivity-focused applications, they can fall short in the context of an affective system designed for personal growth. An AI that simply provides answers or directs action can inadvertently foster dependency and diminish the user's own capacity for judgment.

The **Adversarial Collaboration** framework offers a different paradigm. The term is inspired by the scientific practice where researchers holding opposing theories collaborate to design a single, decisive experiment intended to resolve their disagreement.64 In the context of HAIC, this concept is adapted to describe an interaction where the AI is designed to act as a "supportive antagonist" or a "constructive critic." Its primary function is not to give the user a solution but to help the user arrive at a better solution themselves. It does this by interrogating the user's assumptions, questioning their reasoning, and introducing alternative perspectives.

This model fundamentally preserves user dignity and autonomy because it is predicated on the user being the ultimate locus of authority and decision-making.66 The AI is a cognitive tool, a sparring partner whose purpose is to sharpen the user's own judgment. The goal is not to automate the user's decisions but to augment the user's ability to make better decisions for themselves. This ensures the system acts as an enabler of human capacity, not a replacer of it, keeping the human firmly in command of their own cognitive processes.62

### **3.2 Design Patterns for Collaborative Critique**

The Adversarial Collaboration framework is realized through a set of specific, concrete interaction design patterns. These patterns define how the NudgeEngine will engage with the user in a way that is questioning and challenging, yet supportive.

#### **Pattern 1: The Socratic Critic**

This pattern draws directly from the Socratic method of teaching, which uses guided, probing questions to stimulate critical thinking and self-discovery rather than providing direct answers.67 Instead of issuing a command or a direct piece of advice, the AI agent will ask a reflective question designed to help the user think through a problem or situation on their own terms. This approach is already being explored in the design of advanced AI tutors like Khanmigo, which avoids simply giving students the answer and instead prompts them to consider the next step.68

* **Application Example:** A user is in a "low energy" and "low focus" state, as inferred by the user\_state model, and has an important report due. A traditional nudge might say, "You should start working on the report now." A Socratic nudge, in contrast, would be a gentle, guiding question: "I see the deadline for the report is approaching. It can be tough to start when you're feeling low on energy. What's one small, manageable step you could take just to get started?" This interaction validates the user's current state while empowering them to identify their own path forward, breaking down a daunting task into an achievable first step.70

#### **Pattern 2: The Perspective-Broadening Partner**

This pattern is designed for situations where a user may be experiencing cognitive tunneling, such as during a state of high anxiety or frustration, causing them to focus on a single, narrow course of action. The AI's role is to gently introduce alternative viewpoints or potential consequences, helping the user make a more robust and well-considered decision. This leverages the AI's capacity for sentiment analysis and its ability to reframe a situation from a more neutral standpoint.71

* **Application Example:** The system detects that a user is composing an email with highly negative and aggressive language. Instead of a prohibitive warning like "Don't send this email," the perspective-broadening partner would offer a reflective prompt: "This message seems to carry a lot of strong emotion. Before you send it, would it be helpful to consider how the person receiving it might interpret this tone?" This nudge doesn't forbid the action but encourages the user to engage in perspective-taking, a key component of emotional intelligence, thereby helping them make a more deliberate choice about how to proceed.71

#### **Pattern 3: The On-Demand "Unfiltered" Reviewer**

This pattern provides the user with a powerful tool for self-improvement that is entirely user-initiated and controlled. The user can explicitly summon a specialized AI persona designed to provide direct, unfiltered, and even "brutally honest" feedback on a piece of work, a plan, or an idea. This interaction is never pushed to the user; it is a tool they choose to invoke. This pattern is analogous to the "AI as Adversary" pattern used in some game designs, where the AI provides a challenging opponent for the player to test their skills against.73

* **Application Example:** A user is preparing for a critical job interview and has outlined their answers to common questions. They could explicitly ask the NudgeEngine: "Activate the 'Unfiltered Reviewer' persona. Review my talking points and be as critical as possible. Where are my arguments weak? Which answers sound unconvincing?" This allows the user to benefit from harsh, constructive criticism without the social friction, risk, or emotional labor involved in asking a human colleague for the same level of feedback. The system provides a safe space for rigorous self-assessment, with different agentic personas available for different feedback styles.74

### **3.3 Mechanisms of Agency: Ensuring the User is in Command**

For the Adversarial Collaboration framework to be empowering rather than manipulative, it must be built on a set of non-negotiable principles that guarantee user agency. These mechanisms ensure that the balance of power always resides with the human user.

* **Human-in-Command Control:** This is the foundational principle. In every interaction, the user makes the final decision. The AI can suggest, question, and offer perspectives, but it must never take autonomous action on the user's behalf without explicit, unambiguous, and specific instruction.62 This aligns with the core design principle of ensuring the appropriate level of user autonomy in any AI-supported workflow.66  
* **Transparency and Explainability:** The system must be capable of explaining the reasoning behind its critiques or questions. This is not just about showing the data it used, but about articulating its "thought process." For instance, if the AI asks a Socratic question, it should be able to explain *why* it chose that question (e.g., "I asked about the smallest possible step because breaking down large tasks is a proven strategy for overcoming procrastination when energy is low"). This can be achieved through techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting, which makes the model's intermediate reasoning steps visible and interpretable to the user.75  
* **Easy Resistibility:** All nudges and suggestions from the AI must be effortlessly dismissible. The user should never feel coerced or pressured to engage with the AI's input. The user interface must be designed to make ignoring or closing a prompt a low-friction, penalty-free action.76 This means using clear and visible close buttons, supporting standard dismissal actions like the Escape key, and avoiding any form of manipulative UI design or "guilt-tripping" copy that makes the user feel bad for ignoring the suggestion.76 The AI's interventions should feel like gentle, contextual clues, not demanding interruptions.42

Ultimately, the Adversarial Collaboration framework redefines the purpose of the NudgeEngine. Its goal is not merely to help a user complete a task in the moment, but to serve as a long-term cognitive capacity-building tool. The design patterns employed are rooted in established educational and psychological principles for fostering durable skills. The Socratic Critic pattern, for instance, is based on pedagogical methods designed to cultivate lasting critical thinking abilities, not just to elicit a correct answer.67 Similarly, the Perspective-Broadening Partner encourages the user to repeatedly practice emotional regulation and empathy, skills that are highly transferable to all aspects of life.71

By consistently prompting the user to reflect, analyze their own thinking, and consider alternatives, the system is doing more than nudging them toward a specific action; it is nudging them toward a more reflective and deliberate *way of being*. This aligns with established models of behavior change, which emphasize that effective interventions empower individuals to form better habits and progress through stages of change, ultimately gaining more autonomy.77 Therefore, the success of this framework should not be measured solely by short-term metrics like task completion. The true measure of its success will be the long-term enhancement of the user's own executive function and decision-making capabilities, potentially making them

*less* reliant on the system's nudges over time. In this vision, the NudgeEngine is not a perpetual crutch, but a temporary scaffold for cognitive growth, fulfilling its mission to be a truly empowering tool that respects and develops the user's innate intelligence.

### **Conclusion**

This report has articulated a comprehensive sociotechnical framework for the development of an empowering and trustworthy affective computing system. The framework is built on three interdependent pillars: the democratic legitimation of its rules, a technical architecture of privacy and user sovereignty, and an interaction model designed to preserve human dignity.

First, the principle of **Democratic Legitimation through Co-Design** establishes that for a system designed to influence behavior, its logic cannot be imposed. It must be co-authored with the community it serves. By synthesizing Participatory Design and Value-Sensitive Design, the proposed phased methodology ensures that user values are not just considered but are actively embedded into the system's core functions through a process of shared decision-making. This approach transforms users from passive recipients into active partners, granting the NudgeEngine an ethical mandate to operate.

Second, the commitment to **Privacy by Design via a Local-First Architecture** provides the technical foundation for trust. By prioritizing on-device data storage and processing, the architecture grants users ultimate ownership and control over their sensitive information. This choice is not merely a technical implementation detail but a fundamental expression of the system's respect for user sovereignty. Complemented by end-to-end encryption for optional synchronization and UI patterns for granular consent, this architecture ensures that privacy is the default, uncompromisable state. Furthermore, this architectural choice strategically positions the system for the future adoption of advanced privacy-preserving techniques like Federated Learning and Differential Privacy.

Third, the **Adversarial Collaboration Framework** redefines the human-AI relationship to be one that enhances, rather than supplants, human cognition. By employing design patterns like the Socratic Critic and the Perspective-Broadening Partner, the NudgeEngine moves beyond simple assistance to become a tool for building the user's own capacity for critical thinking and self-reflection. Governed by strict principles of human-in-command control, transparency, and easy resistibility, this interaction model ensures that the system serves as a respectful and dignity-preserving partner in the user's personal growth.

Together, these three pillars form a cohesive and mutually reinforcing structure. The democratic process of co-design informs the values that the privacy architecture must protect. The requirements of a dignity-preserving UI enforce a discipline of clarity and simplicity on the co-created rules. And the local-first architecture provides the necessary infrastructure for future, privacy-preserving AI capabilities. By adhering to this integrated framework, the project can move forward with a clear and principled path toward creating an affective computing system that is not only powerful and effective but also ethical, empowering, and worthy of its users' trust.
