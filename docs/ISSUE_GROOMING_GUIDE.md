# ü§ñ GitHub Issue Grooming System

A comprehensive automated system for maintaining GitHub issue hygiene in the ADHDo project. This system analyzes the codebase, tracks completed features, and provides intelligent recommendations for issue management.

## üéØ Overview

The Issue Grooming System consists of:

1. **Automated Analysis Agent** (`scripts/github_issue_grooming.py`)
2. **Easy-to-use Runner Script** (`scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh`)  
3. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/issue-grooming.yml`)
4. **Comprehensive Reporting** (Markdown reports with actionable recommendations)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze issues and generate report
./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh analyze

# Interactive mode for manual review
./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh interactive --token $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Automatically execute safe recommendations
./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh auto --token $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Dry run to see what would be done
./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh dry-run
```

### GitHub Actions

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for GitHub API access
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"

# Optional: Custom repository (auto-detected by default)
export GITHUB_REPO_OWNER="your_org"
export GITHUB_REPO_NAME="your_repo"
```

### GitHub Token Permissions

Required scopes:
- `repo` - Full repository access
- `issues` - Read and write issues
- `pull_requests` - Create pull requests (for automated reports)

### Customization

The system can be customized by modifying:

**Feature Detection Rules** (`_analyze_feature_completeness`):
```python
# Add new feature detection
self.completed_features['new_feature'] = {
    'status': 'complete',
    'evidence': ['path/to/file.py'],
    'commit_refs': matching_commits
}
```

**Issue Mapping** (`analyze_issue_status`):  
```python
# Map features to issue numbers
feature_to_issue_mapping = {
    'new_feature': [issue_number]
}
```

**Completion Indicators** (`_extract_completion_indicators`):
```python
# Add custom completion patterns
completion_patterns = [
    r'your_custom_pattern',
    r'‚ú®',  # Custom emoji
]
```

## üìö Usage Examples

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Daily: Quick status check
./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh analyze

# Weekly: Full interactive review
./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh interactive --token $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Before releases: Auto-cleanup
./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh auto --token $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# In your workflow
- name: Groom issues
  run: |
    ./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh auto --token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Custom Reports

```bash
# Custom output location
python scripts/github_issue_grooming.py \
  --analyze-only \
  --output custom_report.md \
  --github-token $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission denied executing script:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh
```

**Missing Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install requests structlog
```

**GitHub API rate limiting:**
- Use GitHub token for higher limits
- Add delays between API calls
- Use mock data for development

**No issues detected for closure:**
- Check feature detection logic
- Verify file paths exist
- Review commit message patterns

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
./scripts/run_issue_grooming.sh analyze --verbose

# Python debug mode
python -d scripts/github_issue_grooming.py --analyze-only
```

### Logging

The system logs to:
- **Console** - Real-time progress
- **Reports** - Detailed analysis results
- **GitHub Actions** - Workflow summaries
- **Artifacts** - Persistent report storage
