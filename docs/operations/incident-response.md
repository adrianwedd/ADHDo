### Security Incident Playbook

#### Step 1: Detection and Analysis
```bash
# Check security events
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/security/events?severity=high&limit=50

# Review system logs
tail -f /var/log/mcp-adhd-server/security.log

# Database security check
psql -d mcp_adhd -c "SELECT * FROM security_events WHERE severity IN ('high', 'critical') ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

#### Step 2: Containment
```bash
# Block suspicious IP addresses
sudo ufw insert 1 deny from $SUSPICIOUS_IP

# Disable compromised user accounts
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/users/$USER_ID/disable

# Emergency rate limiting
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/security/emergency-throttle
```

#### Step 3: Eradication and Recovery
```bash
# Clear potentially compromised sessions
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/clear-suspicious

# Force password resets for affected users
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/security/force-password-reset

# Update security rules

```

**Resolution Actions:**
```bash
# Optimize database connections
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/database/optimize-connections

# Clear performance caches
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/cache/clear/performance

# Scale resources if needed
docker-compose up -d --scale app=3
```

kubectl scale deployment mcp-adhd-server --replicas=5
```

##### Level 3: System Unresponsive (> 10 seconds)

**Response Time:** 2 minutes

**Critical Response:**
```bash
# Emergency restart sequence
systemctl restart mcp-adhd-server
systemctl restart postgresql
systemctl restart redis

# Database integrity check
pg_dump mcp_adhd > /backup/emergency_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Activate backup systems
curl -X POST http://backup.mcp-adhd.local/api/activate
```

## 💾 Database Incidents

### Database Performance Issues

#### Query Performance Degradation
```bash
# Identify slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls, total_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE mean_time > 100 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 20;

# Check database connections
SELECT state, count(*) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY state;

# Analyze table statistics
SELECT schemaname, tablename, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY n_live_tup DESC;
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check connection pool status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/database/pool-status

# Reset connection pool

# Perform point-in-time recovery
pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -o "-c recovery_target_time='2025-08-09 10:30:00'"

# Verify data integrity
psql -d mcp_adhd -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
psql -d mcp_adhd -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';"
```

#### Database Corruption Response
```bash
# Immediate assessment
pg_dump --schema-only mcp_adhd > /backup/schema_backup.sql

# Data integrity check
VACUUM VERBOSE ANALYZE;
REINDEX DATABASE mcp_adhd;

# If corruption confirmed:
# 1. Stop all connections
