# **A Neurodiversity-Affirming Framework for Participatory Research: Principles for Accessible, Non-Overwhelming, and Productive Co-Design Workshops**

## **Part I: Foundations of Inclusive Collaboration**

### **Section 1: Beyond User-Centered Design: The Principles of Co-Design and Participatory Action Research**

The effective design of digital health technologies necessitates a deep understanding of the end-user's context, needs, and lived experiences. For decades, User-Centered Design (UCD) has been the dominant paradigm, advocating for designers to observe, interview, and test with users to inform the development process. However, a more profound and collaborative approach, known as Participatory Design (PD), has emerged, particularly in complex domains like healthcare and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This approach reframes the role of the end-user from a passive subject of study to an active and equal partner in the creative process. This section will delineate the principles of PD and its related methodology, co-design, establishing the foundational argument for its application in research with neurodiverse adults.

#### **Defining the Paradigm Shift**

Participatory Design, originally termed co-operative design, represents a fundamental shift in design philosophy. It is an approach that attempts to actively involve all stakeholders—including employees, customers, patients, and end-users—in the design process to ensure the final product meets their needs and is genuinely usable. Unlike UCD, which might involve users at specific touchpoints for feedback or testing, PD integrates them into the entire innovation process, from the initial exploration and definition of a problem to the development and evaluation of solutions. The user is not merely a source of data but a co-creator with a legitimate and valued voice in design decisions.  
This distinction is not merely semantic; it has significant practical and ideological implications. Research suggests that designers create more innovative concepts when working within a co-design environment. Furthermore, a common misconception is that PD requires designers to abdicate their responsibilities; rather, it demands that they become facilitators of a collaborative process, leveraging their expertise to empower and work alongside users. In healthcare, where systems are notoriously complex and involve a multitude of actors, PD has proven invaluable. It treats end-users, whether clinicians or patients, as partners rather than objects of design, grounding the development of new systems in the rich context of their daily work and lived reality. This approach has been used to develop a wide range of healthcare systems, including e-therapy platforms, nationwide eHealth systems, and data entry applications, with a focus on improving accessibility, efficiency, and quality of care.

#### **The Political and Ethical Dimensions**

The roots of Participatory Design are deeply embedded in the Scandinavian workplace democracy movements of the 1970s. It grew from debates about the impact of new computer technologies on workers, with a foundational call for designers to respect the complexity of work practice and engage directly with those who possess lived experience. Consequently, PD carries an inherent political and ethical dimension that extends beyond simple usability. It is an approach aimed at user empowerment and democratization, seeking to give a voice to those who will be most affected by a new technology or system.  
This commitment to empowerment makes PD an especially appropriate methodology for research involving marginalized communities, including people with disabilities and neurodivergent individuals. Historically, research and design processes have been conducted *on* or *for* these communities, often from a perspective that pathologizes their differences. Participatory research methods, in contrast, are based on the premise that research must be done *with* people, with the goal of instigating meaningful change through collective effort. This aligns with the disability justice proclamation, "nothing about us without us," which asserts the right of disabled people to be central to any process that affects their lives. By treating participants as experts in their own experience, PD helps to level the inherent power imbalance between the researcher and the "researched," fostering a more equitable and respectful collaboration.

#### **Application in Healthcare and HCI**

The application of co-design and participatory principles is increasingly recognized as essential in the development of effective healthcare technologies. Healthcare is a deeply personal domain, and each patient's journey is unique. Traditional, expert-led design processes risk creating solutions that, while technically sound, fail to account for the nuanced realities of a patient's life or a clinician's workflow. Co-design bridges this gap by bringing together the "expert of experience" (the patient or user) and the "expert of practice" (the clinician or designer) to collaboratively solve problems.  
This collaborative approach has been shown to yield significant benefits, including the generation of better and more original ideas, a deeper understanding of user needs, more efficient decision-making, and higher user satisfaction and loyalty. In the context of digital health, where user engagement is critical for efficacy, involving end-users in the design process can build the buy-in and trust necessary for sustained use. The process requires designers to acknowledge the limits of their own understanding and to value the diverse expertise that stakeholders bring, including patients, families, caregivers, and clinical staff. This foundation in collaborative, empowering, and context-aware design provides the necessary starting point for developing a framework tailored to the specific needs of neurodivergent adults.

### **Section 2: The Neurodiversity Paradigm in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**

To effectively apply participatory design principles to a neurodivergent population, it is crucial to first understand the philosophical shift encapsulated by the neurodiversity paradigm. This paradigm offers a powerful alternative to traditional medical models of disability and has profound implications for how technology should be designed and evaluated. It provides the "why" that informs the "how" of inclusive co-design.

#### **From Deficit to Difference**

The term "neurodiversity" refers to the natural and valuable variation in human brain functioning, encompassing differences in sociability, learning, attention, and mood. It reframes conditions such as autism, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and dyslexia not as inherent deficits or disorders to be cured, but as natural variations of the human genome. This perspective challenges the pathology paradigm, which has historically dominated medicine and psychology, by advocating for a strengths-based approach that recognizes the unique skills, talents, and perspectives associated with different neurotypes.  
This paradigm shift is closely aligned with the social model of disability. Whereas the medical model locates disability within the individual as a personal failing or tragedy, the social model posits that a person is "disabled" by societal and environmental barriers that fail to accommodate their needs. For example, a wheelchair user is not inherently disabled by their inability to walk but by the presence of stairs and the absence of ramps. Similarly, an autistic individual may not be disabled by their sensory processing differences but by an environment filled with overwhelming fluorescent lights and loud, unpredictable noises. This reframing is critical for design, as it shifts the onus of adaptation from the individual to the environment. The goal of neurodiversity-affirming design is not to make the person "fit" the world, but to make the world fit the person.

#### **Neurodiversity-Affirming Design**

Within the field of HCI, the neurodiversity paradigm has inspired a call for more inclusive and affirming design practices. Neurodiversity-affirming design moves beyond merely creating "assistive technologies" that aim to compensate for perceived deficits. Instead, it seeks to create flexible, adaptable, and empowering experiences that respect and support the full range of human cognition. It acknowledges that there is no single "correct" way to process information, communicate, or interact with the world.  
This approach requires designers to challenge their own neurotypical biases and assumptions about what constitutes a "good" or "intuitive" user experience. For example, an interface that relies heavily on subtle social cues or requires sustained, focused attention may be perfectly usable for a neurotypical user but could create significant barriers for a neurodivergent one. An affirming approach would not try to "train" the neurodivergent user to better interpret these cues, but would instead offer alternative, clearer modes of communication and interaction. It recognizes and values the unique strengths that neurodivergent individuals possess, such as heightened creativity, exceptional attention to detail, strong long-term memory, and novel problem-solving approaches, viewing these not as quirks but as assets.

#### **The Call for Collaboration**

The logical conclusion of adopting a neurodiversity-affirming stance is the recognition that genuine inclusion requires collaboration. Designing *for* a neurodivergent population without their direct and meaningful involvement risks perpetuating the very biases and assumptions the paradigm seeks to dismantle. Researchers in HCI and disability studies have therefore issued a strong call to move from designing for neurodivergent users to designing *with* them, ensuring their lived experiences are the central driving force in the creation of new technologies.  
This establishes a powerful and necessary link between the principles of participatory design discussed in the previous section and the goals of the neurodiversity movement. The adoption of a participatory, co-design methodology is not merely a "best practice" for conducting research with neurodivergent individuals; it is an ethical and functional necessity for creating technology that is truly affirming and effective. A design process led exclusively by neurotypical researchers, no matter how well-intentioned, will inevitably be shaped by neurotypical assumptions about usability, communication, and desirable outcomes. This can result in products that inadvertently seek to normalize neurodivergent behavior or that fail to address the actual, lived needs of the user community.  
Co-design fundamentally disrupts this dynamic. By elevating the neurodivergent participant to the role of "expert of their own experience" and an equal partner in the design process, their perspectives directly inform and correct the inherent biases of the design team. This ensures that the resulting technology is not based on what designers *perceive* the users' needs to be, but on what the users themselves articulate and co-create. Thus, the methodology of co-design and the philosophy of neurodiversity-affirmation are inextricably linked; one cannot be authentically achieved without the other. This understanding transforms the choice of research methodology from a simple procedural detail into a core ethical and functional requirement for any project aiming to serve this community.

## **Part II: Understanding the Participant Experience**

To design accessible, non-overwhelming, and productive workshops, it is essential to first understand the specific cognitive, sensory, and social profiles of the intended participants. While the term "neurodivergent" is a broad umbrella, this report focuses on the characteristics of adults with ADHD and autism, as specified in the user query. This section details these profiles not as a list of deficits, but as a set of distinct processing styles that have direct and actionable implications for workshop design. It culminates in a discussion of cognitive load theory, which provides a unifying scientific framework for understanding the concept of "overwhelm."

### **Section 3: Designing for Attentional and Executive Function Differences (ADHD)**

Individuals with ADHD possess a unique cognitive profile that influences how they engage with tasks, process information, and maintain motivation. A successful workshop design must accommodate these differences, leveraging strengths while mitigating potential challenges.

#### **Cognitive Profile**

The core of the ADHD experience is often characterized by differences in executive functions, which are the set of mental skills that include working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control. In a workshop context, these differences can manifest in several key areas. Challenges with planning and organization can make it difficult to follow complex, multi-step instructions or to structure thoughts during open-ended brainstorming. Difficulties with sustained attention can make long, passive presentations or monotonous tasks particularly taxing, while a high susceptibility to distraction means that both external stimuli (e.g., a conversation in the hallway) and internal stimuli (e.g., a new, interesting idea) can easily pull focus from the task at hand.  
Conversely, individuals with ADHD often exhibit significant cognitive strengths. These include high levels of creativity, the ability to see novel connections between ideas, and a capacity for intense "hyperfocus" when a task is genuinely engaging or interesting. A well-designed workshop will aim to create an environment that minimizes the demands on weaker executive functions while maximizing opportunities to leverage these strengths.

#### **Motivation and Engagement**

The neurobiology of ADHD, particularly differences in the processing of the neurotransmitter dopamine, plays a crucial role in motivation and engagement. The ADHD brain is often described as being constantly on the hunt for stimulation and novelty. This creates a strong preference for activities that provide immediate feedback, clear rewards, and a high degree of engagement. The vibrant colors, shifting landscapes, and instant gratification loops common in digital content are particularly appealing.  
This neurobiological underpinning explains why traditional workshop formats—often characterized by long periods of passive listening, delayed feedback, and abstract goals—can be profoundly challenging for individuals with ADHD. The lack of immediate reward and stimulation can make it difficult to initiate and sustain the mental effort required for participation, leading to boredom and disengagement.

#### **Workshop Implications**

Translating these cognitive and motivational profiles into the context of a co-design workshop reveals several potential challenges that must be proactively managed. The difficulty with task initiation, sometimes referred to as "ADHD paralysis" or "executive paralysis," can make it hard for participants to begin an activity, especially if it seems large, ambiguous, or overwhelming. Once engaged, the challenge shifts to managing attention. A participant might either become disengaged due to boredom or, if a particular aspect of the workshop is highly stimulating, enter a state of hyperfocus, potentially losing track of time and the broader goals of the session.  
Furthermore, the constant search for novelty can manifest as a high rate of task-switching. A participant might jump between different ideas or activities without bringing any to completion, a pattern that mirrors the high app-switching rate observed in digital phenotype studies of ADHD. Therefore, a productive workshop environment for adults with ADHD must be structured to provide clarity, reduce the activation energy for tasks, incorporate novelty and rewards, and gently guide focus without being overly restrictive.

### **Section 4: Designing for Sensory and Social Processing Differences (Autism)**

Autistic individuals experience and process the world in ways that can differ significantly from their neurotypical peers. These differences in cognition, sensory processing, and social interaction are not deficits but core aspects of autistic identity. Designing an inclusive workshop requires a deep respect for and accommodation of these processing styles.

#### **Cognitive and Communication Profile**

A common cognitive trait among autistic individuals is a preference for structure, logic, and predictability. Ambiguous instructions, unstructured activities, or unexpected changes to the agenda can be sources of significant anxiety and confusion. Therefore, providing a clear, detailed plan for the workshop is essential. This includes explicit communication about the goals of each activity, the expected duration, and the desired outcomes.  
Communication style is another critical consideration. Autistic individuals often have a literal interpretation of language and may not intuitively grasp sarcasm, irony, or metaphorical expressions. Instructions and feedback should be direct, concrete, and unambiguous. Similarly, abstract brainstorming can be challenging; grounding ideation in concrete examples, case studies, or tangible prototypes can be much more effective.

#### **Sensory Profile**

Sensory processing differences are a hallmark of the autistic experience. These can involve both hypersensitivity (an over-responsiveness to sensory input) and hyposensitivity (an under-responsiveness). A participant might be hypersensitive to the buzz of fluorescent lights, the smell of perfume, or the texture of a chair, while being hyposensitive to their own body position or temperature. These sensitivities are not mere preferences; they can be profoundly dysregulating and can make it impossible to focus on the workshop's content.  
Creating a "sensory-safe" environment is therefore a non-negotiable aspect of inclusive design. This involves giving participants as much control as possible over their sensory environment. Key considerations include the quality and intensity of lighting, the level of ambient noise, the layout of the room, and even the types of food and drink offered. Providing options—such as a quiet, low-light area for breaks—is crucial for allowing participants to self-regulate and manage their sensory needs throughout the day.

#### **Social Profile**

The social dynamics of a typical workshop can present numerous barriers for autistic participants. Large, unstructured group discussions, rapid turn-taking, and a heavy reliance on non-verbal cues for communication can be overwhelming and exclusionary. The anxiety associated with navigating these complex social demands can consume cognitive resources that would otherwise be available for creative contribution.  
Creating a socially safe and predictable environment is paramount. This can be achieved through several strategies. Keeping workshop groups small and consistent helps to build familiarity and trust. Establishing clear, explicit ground rules for communication—such as avoiding interruptions and giving everyone a chance to speak—can reduce social uncertainty. Using structured activities that do not rely on spontaneous, rapid-fire conversation, such as individual brainstorming followed by a structured sharing round, ensures that all voices can be heard.

### **Section 5: The Centrality of Cognitive Load**

The concept of creating a "non-overwhelming" workshop environment can be moved from a vague aspiration to a concrete design principle through the lens of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CLT provides a scientific framework for understanding how humans process information and why certain learning environments are more effective than others. It is particularly relevant for designing for neurodivergent populations.

#### **Introduction to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)**

CLT is based on the premise that our working memory—the mental workspace where we actively process information—is extremely limited in its capacity. When this capacity is exceeded, learning and performance suffer. CLT identifies three distinct types of load that are placed on working memory during a task:

1. **Intrinsic Cognitive Load:** This is the inherent complexity of the information or task itself. Learning a simple concept has a low intrinsic load, while understanding a complex scientific theory has a high intrinsic load. This load is necessary for learning and cannot be eliminated, though it can be managed through effective instructional design.  
2. **Extraneous Cognitive Load:** This is the mental effort imposed by the way information is presented and is considered unproductive or "bad" load. It is caused by poor design choices, such as cluttered visual layouts, confusing instructions, or distracting background elements. Every bit of mental energy a participant spends trying to decipher a poorly designed slide is energy that is not available for understanding the content of the slide. The primary goal of good instructional design is to minimize extraneous cognitive load.  
3. **Germane Cognitive Load:** This is the "desirable" load associated with the deep processing of information and the construction of long-term knowledge, or "schemas." It is the effortful work of making connections, understanding relationships, and integrating new information with existing knowledge. Effective instructional design seeks to reduce extraneous load to free up working memory capacity for germane load.

#### **CLT and Neurodiversity**

The principles of CLT are universal, but they are especially critical when designing for neurodivergent individuals. Many neurodevelopmental conditions, including ADHD and dyslexia, are associated with differences in executive functions, particularly working memory. This can mean that the available capacity of working memory is smaller or more easily taxed. Consequently, neurodivergent participants may be more susceptible to the negative effects of high extraneous cognitive load.  
Furthermore, factors that might be minor distractions for a neurotypical person can impose a significant extraneous load on a neurodivergent individual. For an autistic person with auditory hypersensitivity, the background hum of an air conditioner is not just an annoyance; it is a constant stream of sensory data that must be actively filtered out, consuming precious working memory resources. For a person with ADHD, a visually cluttered presentation with excessive animations is not just "busy"; it is a set of competing stimuli that actively pull attention away from the core message.  
This connection between neurodivergence and cognitive load provides a powerful and actionable insight. The subjective feeling of being "overwhelmed" is not a sign of a participant's inability to cope, but rather a predictable and preventable outcome of a poorly designed environment that imposes an excessive extraneous cognitive load. This realization fundamentally shifts the responsibility for creating an accessible workshop from the participant to the designer and facilitator. The challenge is not for the participant to "try harder to focus," but for the designer to create an experience that is so clear, structured, and free of distraction that it demands the minimum possible extraneous cognitive effort. By ruthlessly minimizing extraneous load, we maximize the cognitive capacity available for the productive, creative, and collaborative work that is the goal of the workshop.

## **Part III: The ACCESS Framework for Neuro-Inclusive Co-Design Workshops**

Building upon the foundational principles of participatory design and the specific needs of neurodivergent adults, this section introduces a synthesized, actionable framework for planning and executing inclusive co-design workshops. The **ACCESS** framework—**A**daptable, **C**lear, **C**ollaborative, **E**mpowering, **S**ensory-Safe, and **S**caffolded—provides a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure workshop environments are not only accessible and non-overwhelming but also genuinely productive and respectful of all participants.

### **Section 6: An Overview of the ACCESS Framework**

The ACCESS framework is a multi-faceted approach that integrates best practices from HCI, disability studies, and cognitive science. Each principle addresses a critical dimension of the participant experience, from pre-workshop communication to post-workshop data analysis. The framework is designed to be a practical tool for researchers, designers, and facilitators, transforming abstract ideals of inclusion into concrete actions. The following table provides a high-level summary of the framework's core principles.

| Principle | Definition | Rationale for Neuro-Inclusion |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **A**daptable | The workshop process and activities are flexible and offer multiple ways for participants to engage and contribute. | Accommodates diverse communication styles, energy levels, and processing speeds. Allows participants to self-regulate and engage in ways that are most comfortable and effective for them. |
| **C**lear | All communication, instructions, and materials are explicit, direct, and easy to understand. | Reduces cognitive load by minimizing ambiguity and the mental effort required to interpret information. Crucial for participants with literal communication styles or challenges with executive function. |
| **C**ollaborative | Participants are treated as equal partners in the design process, with their expertise and lived experience valued. | Flattens traditional power hierarchies between researcher and participant, fostering trust and mutual respect. Ensures the design process is guided by authentic user needs. |
| **E**mpowering | The process is designed to build participant confidence, agency, and ownership over the outcomes. | Counters the potential for tokenism by ensuring participants have a genuine influence on decisions. Fosters a sense of purpose and motivation, which is critical for sustained engagement. |
| **S**ensory-Safe | The physical and digital environments are designed to minimize sensory overload and provide options for sensory regulation. | Addresses the significant impact of sensory sensitivities (common in autism and ADHD) on comfort, focus, and the ability to participate. Reduces a major source of extraneous cognitive load. |
| **S**caffolded | Complex tasks and information are broken down into smaller, manageable steps, with support provided as needed. | Manages intrinsic cognitive load by structuring learning and participation. Reduces overwhelm and anxiety associated with large or ambiguous tasks, supporting task initiation and completion. |

### **Section 7: The Pre-Workshop Phase: Preparation and Trust-Building**

The success of a co-design workshop is often determined long before the participants enter the room. The pre-workshop phase is a critical opportunity to build trust, manage expectations, and set the stage for a productive and psychologically safe collaboration.

* **Principle: Adaptable & Empowering.** The planning process itself should be participatory. Whenever possible, involve participants or a community advisory board in shaping the workshop agenda, activities, and logistics. This immediately signals that their input is valued and gives them a sense of ownership. Proactively ask about access needs and accommodation requirements rather than waiting for participants to disclose them; this normalizes the process and demonstrates a genuine commitment to inclusion. Offer multiple ways for participants to provide this information, such as through a simple online form, an email, or a brief phone call. Crucially, the consent process must be treated as a foundational element of empowerment. It must be clear, accessible, and ongoing. This means providing information in multiple formats (e.g., standard text, easy-read summaries, video explanations) and explicitly stating that participants can withdraw at any time or opt-out of any specific activity without consequence.  
* **Principle: Clear.** Ambiguity creates anxiety. All communication leading up to the workshop must be exceptionally clear. At least 48 hours in advance, provide participants with a detailed schedule, a list of who will be facilitating and attending, a clear description of the topics to be discussed and the goals of the session, and precise logistical information (including a map or clear virtual link). Using visual aids, such as a pictorial summary of the day's flow, can be particularly helpful for managing expectations and reducing uncertainty.  
* **Principle: Scaffolded.** To reduce the cognitive load during the workshop, provide key materials in advance. This might include background reading, definitions of key terms, or the core questions that will be discussed. This pre-exposure allows participants to process information at their own pace, formulate their thoughts without time pressure, and come to the workshop feeling more prepared and confident. This simple act of scaffolding can significantly lower the intrinsic cognitive load of the in-person activities, freeing up mental resources for creative and collaborative thinking.

### **Section 8: The Workshop Phase: Facilitation, Activities, and Environment**

The "during" phase is where the principles of the ACCESS framework are most visibly enacted. It requires careful attention to the physical environment, the style of communication, and the structure of group activities.

#### **Principle: Sensory-Safe (The Environment)**

The physical environment can either be a source of comfort or a significant source of extraneous cognitive load and distress.

* **Location and Layout:** Choose a quiet location with minimal background noise and foot traffic. The room should be uncluttered, with a clear and logical layout.  
* **Sensory Inputs:** Provide as much individual control over sensory input as possible. Use rooms with adjustable, dimmable lighting and avoid fluorescent lights, which can flicker and hum. Ensure the space is free from strong smells like air fresheners or perfumes.  
* **Comfort and Regulation:** Offer a variety of seating options. Provide a designated quiet "retreat" space where participants can go if they feel overwhelmed, without needing to ask for permission or feel conspicuous. Make sensory tools like fidgets, weighted lap pads, or noise-canceling headphones available and normalize their use.

#### **Principle: Clear & Scaffolded (Facilitation and Communication)**

The facilitator's communication style is a primary tool for managing cognitive load.

* **Language:** Use plain, simple, and direct language. Avoid jargon, acronyms, metaphors, and irony, which can be confusing for literal thinkers. When a technical term must be used, define it clearly.  
* **Instructions:** Break down all instructions into small, sequential steps. Present instructions multimodally—say them out loud, show them on a slide with clear, large, sans-serif font, and provide a written copy on a handout.  
* **Pacing and Time:** Use visual timers to make the passage of time tangible and to signal transitions between activities. This predictability reduces anxiety and helps with time management. Ensure that any time limits are generous and flexible, and avoid timed tasks that create unnecessary pressure.  
* **Support:** For complex activities, provide worked examples, templates, or checklists to guide participants and reduce the intrinsic load of the task. Regularly pause to check for understanding, inviting participants to ask clarifying questions or to paraphrase the instructions in their own words.

#### **Principle: Adaptable & Collaborative (Group Dynamics and Activities)**

The structure of the workshop activities determines whether collaboration is inclusive or exclusionary.

* **Group Size and Structure:** Keep the overall group size small. A ratio of no more than seven participants per facilitator is a good guideline to ensure everyone can be supported. At the beginning of the session, collaboratively establish and display a clear set of ground rules for respectful interaction (e.g., "one person speaks at a time," "all ideas are welcome").  
* **Pacing and Energy:** Treat participant energy as a finite resource. Plan for frequent, short breaks (at least one per hour) to allow for mental and physical rest. Incorporate optional movement breaks or activities that allow participants to stand, stretch, or walk around.  
* **Activity Design:** Prioritize structured activities over open-ended, unstructured discussions. Use methods that allow for individual thinking time before group sharing, such as "silent brainstorming" where participants write ideas on sticky notes individually before posting them for the group to discuss. This prevents a few dominant voices from controlling the conversation and gives everyone time to process and formulate their thoughts. Use structured turn-taking mechanisms, like passing a "talking stick," to ensure equitable participation. Offer multiple ways for participants to contribute, accommodating different communication preferences (e.g., speaking, writing, drawing, using a digital whiteboard).

### **Section 9: The Post-Workshop Phase: Participatory Analysis and Ethical Follow-up**

The collaboration should not end when the workshop concludes. Involving participants in the analysis and interpretation of the data they helped generate is a cornerstone of truly participatory research. This practice enhances the validity of the findings and reinforces the principle of participants as equal partners.

#### **Principle: Collaborative & Empowering**

* **Member Checking:** This is a crucial process for ensuring the trustworthiness of qualitative data. It involves returning to participants with the data or the initial analysis to check for accuracy and resonance. This is not simply a validation exercise; it is an ethical imperative to ensure that participants' voices are represented faithfully and that they have an opportunity to correct or clarify the researcher's interpretations. Several methods can be used:  
  * **Transcript Review:** The researcher can send participants the verbatim transcript of their interview or workshop contribution for review. This offers the highest fidelity but can be time-consuming for the participant.  
  * **Summary Review:** The researcher can provide a synthesized summary of a participant's key points or of the emergent themes from the group. This is less burdensome and focuses on the interpretation rather than the raw data.  
  * **Follow-up Interview:** The researcher can schedule a brief follow-up interview to present the findings and discuss them with the participant, allowing for a richer, more dialogic form of validation.  
* **Participatory Data Analysis:** For a deeper level of collaboration, participants can be invited to become co-researchers in the analysis process itself. This requires a significant commitment to training and support but can yield incredibly rich insights. The RE-STAR project provides an excellent model for this, where young neurodivergent people were trained to conduct thematic analysis of interview transcripts alongside academic researchers. This approach ensures that the interpretation of the data is grounded in lived experience, mitigating the risk of neurotypical researchers misinterpreting or pathologizing neurodivergent perspectives.

#### **Principle: Clear**

Finally, the dissemination of findings must also be inclusive. In addition to publishing in academic journals, researchers have an ethical responsibility to share the results back with the participant community in a format that is accessible and meaningful to them. This might take the form of an easy-read report, a short video summary, or a community presentation. This closes the feedback loop and ensures that the knowledge co-created during the research process benefits the community that made it possible.

#### **Practical Application of the ACCESS Framework**

To make these principles concrete, the following table provides a non-exhaustive list of actionable strategies organized by workshop phase and the ACCESS framework. This tool can be used as a checklist for planning and executing neuro-inclusive co-design workshops.

|  | Adaptable | Clear | Collaborative | Empowering | Sensory-Safe | Scaffolded |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Pre-Workshop** | Offer multiple participation modes (in-person/remote, group/individual). | Send detailed agenda, goals, and logistics well in advance. | Involve participants in agenda-setting and planning. | Clearly explain how participant input will be used and its potential impact. | Ask about sensory needs and accommodations on the registration form. | Provide key readings, questions, or concepts ahead of time. |
|  | Provide accessible consent forms (e.g., easy-read, video). | Use plain language in all communications; avoid jargon. | Co-create a "duty of care" protocol or group agreement. | Let participants choose their preferred communication methods. | Provide photos or a virtual tour of the workshop space. | Provide a glossary of any technical terms that will be used. |
| **During Workshop** | Allow participants to opt-out of any activity without question. | Start with a clear overview of the day's structure and goals. | Use small, consistent groups to build rapport. | Give participants control over their physical space (e.g., seating, lighting). | Use adjustable, non-fluorescent lighting; minimize ambient noise. | Break complex tasks into small, sequential steps. |
|  | Offer multiple ways to contribute (speaking, writing, drawing). | Use visual timers to signal transitions and manage time. | Facilitate, don't lead; position yourself as a learner. | Actively solicit and validate all contributions, especially dissenting ones. | Provide a designated quiet/low-sensory retreat area. | Provide templates or worked examples for activities. |
|  | Be flexible with the agenda; respond to the group's energy. | Give explicit, step-by-step instructions for each activity. | Use structured turn-taking methods (e.g., talking stick). | Encourage peer-to-peer support and collaboration. | Avoid strong scents and visually cluttered environments. | Use multimodal instructions (verbal, visual, written). |
|  | Allow for movement and fidgeting; provide fidget tools. | Regularly summarize key points and check for understanding. | Rotate roles within group activities (e.g., scribe, timekeeper). | Frame activities as explorations, not tests with right/wrong answers. | Ensure comfortable temperature and seating options. | Use graphic organizers to structure brainstorming. |
| **Post-Workshop** | Offer multiple formats for follow-up and feedback (e.g., email, call). | Clearly explain the next steps in the research process. | Involve participants in data analysis (e.g., member checking, co-coding). | Give participants authorship or acknowledgement on outputs, as appropriate. | N/A | Provide summaries of findings in accessible formats. |
|  | Be flexible with deadlines for providing feedback. | Provide clear, jargon-free summaries of findings. | Seek feedback on the co-design process itself for future improvement. | Share how their specific contributions influenced the final outcome. | N/A | N/A |

## **Part IV: Implementation and Ethical Imperatives**

The successful application of the ACCESS framework requires not only a shift in mindset but also the use of practical tools and a steadfast commitment to ethical practice. This final part of the report provides a curated list of resources to support practitioners in implementing these principles and concludes with a detailed discussion of the ethical guidelines that must underpin all co-design work with neurodivergent adults.

### **Section 10: A Curated Toolkit for Practitioners**

Numerous organizations and research groups have developed resources that can be adapted to support neuro-inclusive co-design. This section highlights some of the most valuable toolkits and guidelines.

* **Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit:** Microsoft has developed a comprehensive suite of resources for practicing inclusive design. These tools are designed to be retrofitted to any team's goals and can be invaluable for planning and facilitating workshops. Key downloadable resources include:  
  * **Inclusive 101 Guidebook (PDF):** Provides a foundational understanding of inclusive design principles, such as "Recognize exclusion," "Learn from diversity," and "Solve for one, extend to many".  
  * **Inclusive Design for Cognition Guidebook (PDF):** This guide is particularly relevant, offering an introduction to designing for the diversity of human cognition. It can inform the creation of workshop materials and activities that are mindful of different processing styles.  
  * **Inclusive Design for Mental Health Guidebook & Cards (PDF):** These resources extend the cognitive framework specifically to mental health, providing guidance on how to create experiences that are respectful and supportive, a crucial consideration for workshops that may touch on sensitive topics.  
  * **Inclusive Activity Cards (PDF):** This is a practical tool for facilitators. The cards provide structured activities designed to "jump-start creative thinking and stress-test concepts through an inclusive lens." Activities like "Computer Trust" and "Human-to-Computer Role-Play" can be adapted to explore user needs and expectations in a structured, engaging way.  
* **Neurodiversity Design System:** This online resource translates principles of neurodiversity and user experience into a set of concrete design standards for learning interfaces. While focused on digital learning, its principles are directly applicable to the design of workshop materials like presentations and handouts. It provides specific guidance on:  
  * **Typography:** Recommends clear, sans-serif fonts and appropriate line spacing to improve readability, a key factor for participants with dyslexia or other reading challenges.  
  * **Color:** Offers advice on using color contrast effectively to ensure information is perceptible, which is important for users with visual or sensory sensitivities.  
  * **Interface:** Provides principles for creating uncluttered, consistent, and predictable layouts, which directly supports the goal of reducing extraneous cognitive load.  
* **Consolidated Checklists and Guides:** Practitioners can synthesize existing resources to create their own practical tools. For example, by combining insights from the Autism Support Checklist , which focuses on individual communication styles and triggers, and the AUDE Neurodiversity Design Guide , which focuses on the built environment, a facilitator could develop a comprehensive "Pre-Workshop Accessibility and Environment Checklist" to ensure all logistical and sensory factors have been considered.

### **Section 11: Ethical Guidelines for Responsible Co-Design**

Beyond practical techniques, responsible co-design with neurodivergent adults is rooted in a deep ethical commitment. This involves a constant reflection on power, consent, safety, and reciprocity.

* **Power Dynamics:** Acknowledge and actively work to mitigate the inherent power imbalance between researchers and participants. The researcher often holds institutional authority, controls the funding, and sets the initial agenda. A core ethical task is to shift this dynamic, moving from the role of "expert" to that of "facilitator" or "coach". This requires genuine humility and a willingness to learn from the lived expertise of the participants. This shift is what enables a transition from tokenistic consultation to true, empowering collaboration.  
* **Informed and Ongoing Consent:** Consent is not a document to be signed and filed away; it is a continuous, dialogic process. Participants must be fully informed about the research in accessible language, understanding what data is being collected, how it will be used, and any potential risks. Most importantly, they must be repeatedly reminded of their right to withdraw from the study, or any part of it, at any time, without needing to provide a reason and without any negative consequences. This is particularly crucial in a workshop setting, where a participant might feel social pressure to continue with an activity that is causing them discomfort.  
* **Psychological Safety and Trust:** Creating a space where participants feel safe to be authentic and vulnerable is the foundation of any meaningful co-design process. This is achieved through the consistent application of the ACCESS principles. It begins with establishing clear ground rules for respectful dialogue , requires facilitators to model vulnerability and non-judgment, and depends on a steadfast commitment to confidentiality. Trust is not assumed; it is built over time through consistent, respectful, and responsive interactions.  
* **Compensation and Reciprocity:** Participants in co-design are not subjects; they are expert consultants providing invaluable insights based on their lived experience. They must be fairly and transparently compensated for their time, effort, and expertise. This financial compensation is a practical acknowledgement of the value of their contribution. Beyond finances, reciprocity also involves ensuring that the research process itself is a positive and enriching experience for participants and that the outcomes of the research are shared back with the community in a way that provides tangible benefit.

The following matrix provides a tool for researchers to proactively identify and mitigate potential ethical risks when planning participatory research with neurodivergent adults.

| Potential Risk | Guiding Principle(s) | Proposed Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sensory Overload** | Sensory-Safe, Adaptable | Conduct a pre-workshop sensory audit of the space. Provide a quiet retreat room. Offer noise-canceling headphones. Allow participants to control lighting and seating where possible. |
| **Cognitive Overload** | Clear, Scaffolded | Break down complex tasks into small, manageable steps. Provide clear, multimodal instructions. Use visual aids and templates. Schedule frequent breaks. Send materials in advance. |
| **Miscommunication/Misinterpretation** | Clear, Collaborative | Use plain, literal language. Avoid jargon and metaphors. Regularly check for understanding using paraphrasing. Offer multiple communication channels (verbal, written, visual). |
| **Social Anxiety/Exclusion** | Collaborative, Empowering | Use small, consistent groups. Establish clear ground rules for respectful turn-taking. Use structured activities that don't rely on spontaneous social skills. Facilitate, don't dominate. |
| **Tokenistic Participation** | Empowering, Collaborative | Involve participants in decision-making from the earliest stages (e.g., agenda setting). Ensure participant feedback directly and visibly influences outcomes. Offer roles with real responsibility (e.g., co-facilitator, co-analyst). |
| **Emotional Distress** | Sensory-Safe, Empowering | Frame the workshop as a safe, non-judgmental space. Make it clear that participants can opt-out of any activity or take a break at any time. Have a clear protocol for responding to participant distress. |
| **Data Misinterpretation** | Collaborative, Empowering | Use member checking to ensure interpretations resonate with participants' lived experiences. Involve participants in the data analysis and theme generation process. |

By integrating these foundational principles, practical strategies, and ethical commitments, researchers and designers can move toward a more inclusive and equitable practice. Co-design with neurodivergent adults is not about finding a one-size-fits-all solution, but about creating a flexible, respectful, and empowering process that celebrates the full spectrum of human diversity and, in doing so, leads to better, more innovative, and more human-centered outcomes for everyone.
