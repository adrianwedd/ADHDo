# ADHDo Implementation Plan - Reality-Focused Roadmap

## Current State Assessment
- ✅ Core infrastructure exists (over-engineered but functional)
- ✅ Safety systems implemented (needs validation)
- ⚠️ Basic chat works but needs reliability improvements
- ❌ Calendar integration not connected
- ❌ Mobile UX needs work

## Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)

### 1. Validate Core Safety (Issue #55) - CRITICAL
**Why**: Mental health crisis detection must work perfectly
- Test crisis detection patterns
- Validate circuit breaker behavior  
- Ensure deterministic safety responses
- Document emergency access procedures

### 2. Fix Response Times (Issue #42) - HIGH
**Why**: ADHD users lose focus after 3 seconds
- Measure actual response times
- Fix any bottlenecks over 3 seconds
- Add simple performance logging (not full APM)
- Test with realistic ADHD interaction patterns

### 3. Basic Chat Reliability
**Why**: Core feature must work consistently
- Ensure cognitive loop processes correctly
- Fix any error handling gaps
- Test session persistence across restarts
- Validate ADHD-optimized responses (short, clear)

## Next Phase (Week 3-4)

### 4. Calendar Integration (Issue #25) - HIGH  
**Why**: Time blindness is core ADHD challenge
- Implement Google Calendar OAuth
- Read upcoming events (24 hour window)
- Surface calendar in chat context
- Add time-based nudges

### 5. Mobile Accessibility (Issue #54) - MEDIUM
**Why**: Users need access everywhere
- Fix touch target sizes
- Ensure responsive layout
- Test with screen readers
- Optimize for one-handed use

## Future Considerations (Month 2+)

### 6. Enhanced Personalization
- Learn user patterns
- Adapt response style
- Improve nudge timing

### 7. Task Management Integration
- Break down complex tasks
- Procrastination intervention
- Working memory support

## What We're NOT Doing

❌ Multi-domain architecture (MCP-Therapy, MCP-Learn)
❌ Enterprise monitoring stacks
❌ Complex authentication flows
❌ Native mobile apps
❌ Advanced ML pipelines (until basics work)

## Success Metrics

1. **Safety**: Zero missed crisis detections
2. **Performance**: 95% of responses <3 seconds
3. **Reliability**: 99% uptime for core chat
4. **Usability**: Works on mobile without frustration
5. **Value**: Users report improved executive function

## Development Principles

1. **Safety First**: Never compromise crisis detection
2. **ADHD-Focused**: Every feature addresses real ADHD needs
3. **Simple > Complex**: Prefer working simple solution over perfect complex one
4. **Test Critical Paths**: Safety and core features get thorough testing
5. **User Feedback**: Let real usage guide development

## Weekly Checkpoints

- **Week 1**: Safety validation complete, performance measured
- **Week 2**: Core chat reliable, response times fixed
- **Week 3**: Calendar integration working
- **Week 4**: Mobile UX acceptable

## Notes

This plan focuses on making the existing system reliable and useful rather than adding new complexity. The extensive infrastructure already built can be leveraged, but the focus is on user value, not technical impressiveness.

The goal: A working ADHD support tool that helps real users, not a technical showcase.
