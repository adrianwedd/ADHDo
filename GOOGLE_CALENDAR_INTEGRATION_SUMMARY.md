## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points

#### MCP Cognitive Loop
- Calendar context automatically included in all user interactions
- Real-time schedule awareness enhances response relevance
- Proactive nudging based on upcoming events and transitions

#### Nudge Engine Extension
- Calendar events trigger transition warnings
- Preparation reminders sent at optimal times
- Overwhelm warnings prevent schedule overload
- Hyperfocus break suggestions during long work blocks

#### Context Building
- Current event awareness in user conversations
- Upcoming event preparation needs
- Schedule density and overwhelm indicators
- Time awareness and remaining commitment calculations

### Data Models

#### CalendarEvent (Enhanced)

- Preparation time and materials needed
- Transition difficulty assessment
- Custom alert timing

#### CalendarInsight (Analysis)
- Overwhelm scoring and density analysis
- Energy management recommendations
- Difficult transition identification
