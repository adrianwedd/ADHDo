- #6 - Development Roadmap update (documentation)
- #5 - MCP-Therapy domain (phase-2)
- #2 - Second MCP domain research (phase-2)

## 🔧 Technical Debt Assessment

### **Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **Module Import Problems** - Server failing to start due to import path issues
2. **Test Suite Failures** - 11 import errors in test collection
3. **Documentation Drift** - NEXT_STEPS.md references Phase 0, but we're post-production
4. **Environment Setup** - Virtual environment dependencies not fully aligned

### **Performance & Infrastructure:**
- ✅ **Target achieved:** <3s response time performance breakthrough
- ✅ **Production ready:** Comprehensive deployment infrastructure
- ✅ **Testing coverage:** Extensive unit/integration/e2e test suites
- ⚠️ **Runtime issues:** Server startup failures due to import paths
