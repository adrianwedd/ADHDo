## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING (When Stuff Gets Wonky - We Got You!)

> **🎯 ADHD TL;DR:** Common fixes for when your ADHD server acts up. No shame, no judgment - tech breaks sometimes. Here's how to fix it without losing your mind! 🔧⚡

### 🚨 "Server Won't Start" (The Most Common Hiccup)

**🎯 ADHD TL;DR**: Usually Docker not running or another app stealing your port. Easy fixes!

#### 🔧 Quick Victory Steps:
```bash
# 🎯 Step 1: Is Docker awake?
docker --version
# See version info? Docker is running! 🎉
# Get errors? Start Docker Desktop or run: sudo systemctl start docker

# ⚡ Step 2: Port detective work
lsof -i :8000
# Something there? Another app is using your port!

# 🚀 Step 3: Easy port fix
# Edit docker-compose.yml, change "8000:8000" to "8080:8000"
# Then visit http://localhost:8080 instead
# BOOM! Port conflict solved! 🎉
```

#### 💡 **Pro ADHD Tip**: Docker Desktop makes this easier - just click start!

### 🤖 "Can't Connect to OpenAI" (AI Brain Not Responding)

**🎯 ADHD TL;DR**: Usually API key issues or account needs credits. Quick detective work!

#### 🔍 Diagnose Your AI Connection:
```bash
# 🧠 Test your API key magic
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-key-here"

# 🎉 Success = Long list of AI models
# 💔 Error = One of these fixes needed:
```

#### 🚀 Quick Fixes (In Order of Likelihood):
1. **🔑 API Key Typos** → Check .env file, no extra spaces or line breaks
2. **💰 Account Credits** → Visit OpenAI billing, add $5-10 credit
3. **🚨 Key Permissions** → Create new API key with full permissions
4. **🌐 Network Issues** → Try again in a few minutes

#### 💙 **ADHD Friendly Reminder**: These issues are common and fixable! You're not broken!

### 🗃️ "Database Errors" (The Data Storage Hiccup)

**🎯 ADHD TL;DR**: Database container got confused. Usually fixable with restart magic!

#### 🔧 Database Revival Steps:
```bash
# 🎯 Step 1: Check what's actually running
docker-compose ps
# Look for "db" service - is it "Up" or "Exited"?

# ⚡ Step 2: Try the gentle restart
docker-compose restart db
# Wait 30 seconds, test your site again

# 🚀 Step 3: Nuclear option (if still broken)
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
# Fresh start! (Loses test data but that's fine)
```

#### 💡 **ADHD Note**: Database issues look scary but are usually just "turn it off and on again"!

### ⏰ "Too Slow / Timing Out" (Attention Span Killer Alert!)

**🎯 ADHD TL;DR**: Your server needs more power or OpenAI is having a moment. Let's speed this up!

#### 🚀 Speed Boost Fixes:
```bash
# 🔍 Step 1: Resource detective work
docker stats
# High CPU/RAM usage? Your computer is working too hard!

# ⚡ Step 2: Quick performance fixes
# 1. Close Chrome tabs (you know you have 47 open)
# 2. Quit other apps hogging resources
# 3. Increase Docker memory: Docker → Settings → Resources

# 🧠 Step 3: Faster AI model (trade-off: speed vs intelligence)
# Edit .env file: MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo
# Restart: docker-compose restart adhd-server
```

#### 💪 **ADHD Performance Promise**: Sub-3-second responses or we fix it!
