# Google Fit Data Enhancement Plan

## 🚨 Current State: UNDERUTILIZED

### What We're Getting vs Using:

| Data Type | Collecting? | Using? | ADHD Value |
|-----------|------------|--------|------------|
| Steps | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Basic movement tracking |
| Calories | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Energy expenditure patterns |
| Distance | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Activity intensity |
| Active Minutes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Movement quality |
| Sleep | ❌ No | ❌ No | **CRITICAL** for ADHD |
| Heart Rate | ❌ No | ❌ No | Stress/medication monitoring |
| Activity Type | ❌ No | ❌ No | Hyperactivity detection |

## 📊 Database Storage: NONE!

Currently only using Redis (volatile):
- Loses everything on restart
- No historical analysis
- No pattern learning
- No progress tracking

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes Needed:

### 1. Use ALL Fit Data We're Already Getting:
```python
# In claude_cognitive_engine_v2.py
fitness = google_context.get("fitness", {})
steps = fitness.get("steps_today", 0)
calories = fitness.get("calories_burned", 0)  # ADD THIS
distance = fitness.get("distance_meters", 0)  # ADD THIS
active_mins = fitness.get("active_minutes", 0)  # ADD THIS

# Use for better decisions:
energy_expenditure = calories / (active_mins or 1)  # Intensity
movement_quality = active_mins / (steps / 100 or 1)  # Quality vs quantity
```

### 2. Add Sleep Data Collection:
```python
def get_sleep_data(self) -> Dict:
    """Get last night's sleep data."""
    # Query com.google.sleep.segment
    # Return: duration, quality, wake_times
```

### 3. Add Heart Rate Monitoring:
```python
def get_heart_metrics(self) -> Dict:
    """Get heart rate and HRV."""
    # Query com.google.heart_rate.bpm
    # Calculate: resting_hr, current_hr, variability
```

### 4. Implement Proper Database Storage:
```python
# Store EVERYTHING in PostgreSQL:
- All decisions with full context
- All state snapshots
- All Google API data
- User patterns over time
- Medication effectiveness tracking
- Sleep-focus correlations
```

## 🎯 ADHD-Specific Insights We're Missing:

### Sleep → Focus Correlation:
- Poor sleep = medication less effective
- Track: sleep_hours → next_day_focus_rating

### Movement Quality vs Quantity:
- 10,000 slow steps ≠ 5,000 active steps
- Use active_minutes/steps ratio

### Energy Crash Prediction:
- Calories_burned + time_since_food + medication_timing
- Predict crashes BEFORE they happen

### Stress Detection:
- Heart rate + calendar_conflicts + task_overdue_count
- Intervene before overwhelm

## 📈 What This Would Enable:

1. **Personalized Medication Reminders**
   - Based on sleep quality
   - Adjusted for activity level
   - Timed for optimal effectiveness

2. **Predictive Energy Management**
   - "You'll likely crash at 3pm based on your morning activity"
   - "Take a break now to avoid hyperfocus burnout"

3. **Movement Quality Coaching**
   - "You've walked a lot but slowly - try 5 minutes of energetic movement"
   - "Your heart rate suggests anxiety - try grounding exercises"

4. **Sleep-Performance Insights**
   - "You focus 40% better with 7+ hours sleep"
   - "Your medication works best when you sleep before midnight"

## 🚀 Implementation Priority:

1. **NOW**: Use calories/distance/active_minutes we're already getting
2. **WEEK 1**: Add PostgreSQL storage for all decisions
3. **WEEK 2**: Implement sleep tracking
4. **WEEK 3**: Add heart rate monitoring
5. **MONTH 2**: Build pattern analysis from historical data

## The Bottom Line:

We're using **< 20% of available Fit data** and storing **0% permanently**. This is like having a Ferrari and only using first gear!
